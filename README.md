# KNN-Algorithm
# Project Title :Make the prediction for "iris.csv" using KNN algorithm of Machine Learning, to find the value of K for Supervised Learning Cluster.
# import libraries.
# Load the Iris dataset
# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
# Create a kNN classifier with k=3
# Train the classifier on the training data
